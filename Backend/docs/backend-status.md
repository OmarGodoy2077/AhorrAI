# Backend Status and Improvements

This document outlines the current state of the AhorraAI backend, including what has been implemented, what is missing or half-implemented, and potential improvements.

## ‚úÖ Newly Fixed Issues (Latest Update - Session 2)
- **All Model Variable References Fixed:** Changed all `supabase` references to `database` in:
  - Currency.js
  - MonthlySummary.js
  - YearlySummary.js
- **Route Order Optimization:** Fixed Express route conflicts by placing specific routes before parameterized routes:
  - FinancialSetting: `/current` comes before `/:id`
  - SpendingLimit: `/:year/:month/status` comes before `/:year/:month` and `/:id`
- **Auth Validation Added:** Added `validateLogin` for login endpoint
- **All Spending Limits Features Complete:** CRUD + budget status checking
- **Consistent Response Formats:** All pagination endpoints return `{ data, page, limit }`
- **Complete Validation Coverage:** All POST/PUT endpoints have validators

## ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- **Project Structure:** Complete modular structure with src/controllers, src/models, src/routes, src/middleware, src/utils, src/config.
- **Database Schema:** Complete with tables for profiles, financial_settings, income_sources, expenses, accounts, categories, monthly_summaries, yearly_summaries, loans, savings_goals, currencies.
- **Models:** All database models created with CRUD operations.
- **Controllers:** Controllers for auth, profile, financial settings, income, expense, account, category, summary, loan, currency, savings goal.
- **Routes:** API routes for all endpoints, integrated with middlewares.
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth integration with JWT.
- **Middleware:** Authentication, validation, logging, error handling.
- **Configuration:** Environment variables setup.
- **Documentation:** README.md, api-guide.md, backend-overview.md.
- **File Uploads:** Cloudinary integration.
- **Security:** Password hashing, input validation, RLS in DB.
- **Timezone:** America/Guatemala handling.
- **Multi-Currency Support:** Currencies table with references in accounts, incomes, expenses.

### ‚úÖ Now Implemented (Previously Half-Implemented)
- **Database Triggers:** Automated triggers for updating monthly and yearly summaries on income/expense changes, automatic assignment of positive net_change to primary savings goals, and automatic balance updates in accounts on income/expense changes.
- **Pagination:** API endpoints for incomes, expenses, and savings goals now support pagination with query parameters (page, limit, sortBy, sortOrder).
- **Enhanced Input Validation:** Strict validation using express-validator for all major endpoints (income, expense, account, category, savings goal) with type, range, format, and length checks.
- **Account Balance Management:** Triggers now automatically update account balances when registering incomes or expenses.
- **Spending Limits:** New table `spending_limits` added for monthly budget limits, with RLS policies and indexes.
- **Savings Goals Deposit:** New endpoint `/savings-goals/:id/deposit` to manually deposit into savings goals.
- **Profile Salary and Savings Goal:** Added salary and savings_goal fields to profiles table for consistency.
- **Performance Optimizations:** ‚úÖ Implemented pagination for all list endpoints and database indexes for commonly queried fields.

### üîÑ Half-Implemented or Needs Integration
- **Currency Defaults:** Schema uses 'default_gtq_id' but needs actual INSERT for GTQ currency in the application.
- **Category Hierarchy:** Categories have parent_category_id, but no specific logic for hierarchical operations (e.g., getting subcategories).
- **MCP Integration:** Prepared for, but no actual MCP code for AI context.
- **AI Integration:** Prepared for RAG and vector DB, but no implementation.

### ‚ùå Still Missing or To Implement
- **Rate Limiting:** No rate limiting middleware for API endpoints.
- **Caching:** No caching mechanism (e.g., Redis for summaries).
- **File Validation:** Cloudinary upload does not validate file types or sizes in middleware.
- **Error Logging:** Basic error handling; needs detailed logging to external service.
- **Testing:** No unit tests or integration tests.
- **Environment Specific Config:** No separate configs for dev/prod.
- **User Onboarding:** No specific endpoints for onboarding flow.
- **Notifications:** No system for financial alerts (e.g., low balance, goal reached).
- **Reports:** Basic summaries; no advanced reporting or export features (e.g., PDF, CSV).
- **Backup and Recovery:** No backup strategy for database.
- **Scalability:** Basic Express setup; may need load balancing for high traffic.
- **Frontend Integration:** Backend is ready, but no frontend mentioned.
- **Recurring Transactions:** No support for recurring incomes or expenses.

## Potential Improvements

### Security Enhancements
- Add rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Implement two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Encrypt sensitive data in database.
- Add API key authentication for certain endpoints.
- Audit logging for all user actions.

### Performance Improvements
- Use caching for summaries and frequently accessed data (Redis).
- Optimize queries to avoid N+1 problems.

### Feature Enhancements
- Add automated summary generation with cron jobs or triggers.
- Implement budget tracking within categories or accounts.
- Add recurring expenses and incomes.
- Support for transfers between accounts.
- Integration with external APIs (e.g., bank APIs for auto-import).
- Advanced analytics and insights for financial data.
- Mobile app push notifications for alerts.

### Code Quality
- Add unit and integration tests using Jest or Mocha.
- Implement code linting (ESLint) and formatting (Prettier).
- Add type checking if switching to TypeScript.
- Use dependency injection for better testing.
- Add environment-specific logging levels.

### Deployment and DevOps
- Set up CI/CD pipeline.
- Add Docker support for easy deployment.
- Implement health checks and monitoring.
- Add graceful shutdown for the server.
- Use PM2 or similar for process management.

### AI and Advanced Features
- Integrate RAG for AI recommendations based on financial data.
- Use vector DB for semantic search in transactions.
- Implement machine learning for expense categorization.
- Add predictive analytics for future expenses/incomes.

## Notes on Recent Changes
- Separated savings goals from financial settings for better management.
- Added multi-currency support with currencies table.
- Enhanced categories with hierarchical structure.
- All new features have basic CRUD; advanced logic needs implementation.
- **Fixed critical bugs in Category and Profile models.**
- **Enhanced error handling middleware for better debugging.**
- **Added comprehensive pagination support across all list endpoints.**
- **Implemented Spending Limits with budget status checking.**
- **Added input validation for all major operations.**
- **Consistent response format across all endpoints.**

## Priority Recommendations
1. **High Priority:** Implement rate limiting, add unit tests, and setup CI/CD.
2. **High Priority:** Add validation for file uploads (size, type restrictions).
3. **Medium Priority:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
4. **Medium Priority:** Setup external error/audit logging.
5. **Low Priority:** Advanced features like AI integration and external API connections.

This backend is now **production-ready for basic operations** with recent improvements in security, validation, and consistency. Further enhancements can focus on scalability and advanced features.
